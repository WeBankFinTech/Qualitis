## Overview
Qualitis is a one-stop data quality management platform that supports quality verification, notification, and management for various datasource. It is used to solve various data quality problems caused by data processing.

Based on Spring Boot, Qualitis submits quality model task to [Linkis](https://github.com/WeBankFinTech/Linkis) platform. It provides functions such as data quality model construction, data quality model execution, data quality verification, reports of data quality generation and so on.

At the same time, Qualitis provides enterprise-level features of financial-level resource isolation, management and access control. It is also guaranteed working well under high-concurrency, high-performance and high-availability scenarios.
